	abstract = {The Asian vinegar fly Drosophila suzukii (spotted wing Drosophila [{SWD}]) has emerged as a major invasive insect pest of small and stone fruits in both the Americas and Europe since the late 2000s. While research efforts have rapidly progressed in Asia, North America, and Europe over the past 5 years, important new insights may be gained in comparing and contrasting findings across the regions affected by {SWD}. In this review, we explore common themes in the invasion biology of {SWD} by examining (1) its biology and current pest status in endemic and recently invaded regions; (2) current efforts and future research needs for the development of predictive models for its geographic expansion; and (3) prospects for both natural and classical (=importation) biological control of {SWD} in invaded habitats, with emphasis on the role of hymenopteran parasitoids. We conclude that particularly fruitful areas of research should include fundamental studies of its overwintering, host-use, and dispersal capabilities; as well as applied studies of alternative, cost-effective management techniques to complement insecticide use within the integrated pest management framework. Finally, we emphasize that outreach efforts are critical to effective {SWD} management by highlighting successful strategies and insights gained from various geographic regions.},

	abstract = {The Spotted Wing Drosophila ({SWD}), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is a harmful insect pest for soft fruit cultivations. Even though its main hosts belong to the genera Prunus and Rubus, its high polyphagy and adaptability to new environments makes it a serious problem for farmers worldwide, who have reported several economic losses because of this pest. A wide series of proposals to control {SWD} are available and operate in line with the mechanisms of integrated pest management, demonstrating their high efficiency when applied at the opportune moment. This work aims to apply and validate a physiologically based model which summarises all the available information about D. suzukii biology, such as the relationship between environmental temperature and its development, fertility and mortality rates. The model provided, as a result, a description of a population of {SWD} females taking into consideration the multiple generations that occurred during the year. Simulations were then compared with field data collected in a three-year survey in two experimental fields located in the Sabina Romana area (Lazio, Italy). More specifically, D. suzukii males were monitored with traps in fields cultivated with mixed varieties of cherries and they were selected because of their clearer identification in comparison to females. Results showed a high level of reliability of simulations in representing the field data, highlighting at the same time that there is no discrepancy in simulating D. suzukii females in order to represent male populations.},

Models formulated in this paper are continuous-time, include a strong Allee effect that captures extinction events, and incorporate different strategies of releasing sterile insects. We perform basic studies of dynamical features of these models, with an emphasis on the condition of excitation, and the impact of the different release methods is investigated.

	abstract = {This study examined how variation in a critical environmental variable, protein content in the adult diet, influenced male mating signals, mating success and male ‘quality’ in a lekking HawaiianDrosophila,D.grimshawi. Specifically, the effects of low- and high-protein-containing diets on male physical condition, courtship behaviour, copulation success and adult offspring production were investigated. Potential differences in attractiveness to females were investigated by recording times to mating. Males fed high-protein diets were in better physical condition, courted more vigorously, and mated more often and sooner than males fed low-protein diets. Matings involving males fed a high-protein diet resulted in more eclosing offspring than matings involving low-protein-fed males. Because females control when mating occurs in this species, these results indicate that females may have preferred males fed high-protein diets. The results are discussed in light of recent questions regarding female choice and the possible benefits that females of lekking species might gain by discriminating between males.},

	abstract = {In principle, the sterile insect technique ({SIT}) is applicable to controlling a wide variety of insect pests, but biological factors, interacting with socio-economic and political forces, restrict its practical use to a narrower set of pest species and situations. This chapter reviews how the biology and ecology of a given pest affect the feasibility and logistics of developing and using the {SIT} against that pest insect. The subjects of pest abundance, distribution, and population dynamics are discussed in relation to producing and delivering sufficient sterile insects to control target populations. Pest movement and distribution are considered as factors that influence the feasibility and design of {SIT} projects, including the need for population- or area-wide management approaches. Biological characteristics, that affect the ability of sterile insects to interact with wild populations, are presented, including the nature of mating systems of pests, behavioural and physiological consequences of mass production and sterilization, and mechanisms that males use to block a female’s acquisition and/or use of sperm from other males. An adequate knowledge of the biology of the pest species and potential target populations is needed, both for making sound decisions on whether integration of the {SIT} into an area-wide integrated pest management ({AWIPM}) programme is appropriate, and for the efficient and effective application of the technique.},

This review summarizes the current information about the biology and dispersal of D. suzukii and discusses the current status and prospects of control methods for the management of this pest. We highlight current knowledge and ongoing research on innovative environmental-friendly control methods with emphasis on the sterile insect technique ({SIT}) and the incompatible insect technique ({IIT}). {SIT} has been successfully used for the containment, suppression or even eradication of populations of insect pests. {IIT} has been proposed as a stand-alone tool or in conjunction with {SIT} for insect pest control. The principles of {SIT} and {IIT} are reviewed, and the potential value of each approach in the management of D. suzukii is analyzed. We thoroughly address the challenges of {SIT} and {IIT}, and we propose the use of {SIT} as a component of an area-wide integrated pest management approach to suppress D. suzukii populations. As a contingency plan, we suggest a promising alternative avenue through the combination of these two techniques, {SIT}/{IIT}, which has been developed and is currently being tested in open-field trials against Aedes mosquito populations. All the potential limiting factors that may render these methods ineffective, as well as the requirements that need to be fulfilled before their application, are discussed.},

Regardless of this, their global importance in public health has led numerous research teams to attempt to use the mosquito sterile insect technique against several species. Because of the degree of financial commitment required for suppression programs, most releases have consisted of preliminary investigations of male performance, population characteristics, and production methods. Those that have accomplished suppression provide important insights regarding the challenges of production, dispersal, and immigration. Insights gained from these studies remain relevant today, regardless of the genetic control technology being applied. In this article, I highlight studies that were notable for the insights that were gained, the intrinsic difficulties that mosquitoes present, and synthesize these into recommendations for successful applications of the sterile insect technique and newer technologies to mosquitoes.},

These enzymes can metabolise the insecticide to render it less toxic and facilitate its elimination from the organism. The P450 Cyp6g1 was identified as the major factor responsible for {DDT} resistance in Drosophila melanogaster field populations. In this article, we review the data available for this gene since it was associated with resistance in 2002.

Subsequently, its known distribution in China has rapidly expanded to another 11 provinces (Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangxi, Shandong, Hainan, Hebei, Henan, Hubei and Anhui), where it is currently causing considerable damage and economic losses. Experimental research and field surveys have contributed to our understanding of the ecology of L. trifolii and particularly the process of invasion and its interactions with other established, exotic Liriomyza leafminer species. A number of factors have contributed to the successful establishment of L. trifolii and displacement of interspecific competitors. In China, L. trifolii has become a particularly devastating pest in areas with intensive farming with extensive monocultures and a reliance on insecticide use. Integrated pest management incorporating judicious applications of insecticide combined with biological and cultural controls is likely to provide the best long-term management strategy for L. trifolii. We provide information regarding 10 years of L. trifolii invasion in China and discuss areas of future research to enhance our overall understanding of the biology and ecology of L. trifolii and to improve management programmes for this widespread invasive insect pest. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Une invasion biologique réussie se décompose en trois étapes : l'introduction d'une population allochtone sur une nouvelle aire de répartition géographique, l'établissement de populations viables et leur prolifération exponentielle dans l'aire d'introduction. En 2002, Shea et Chesson ont énoncé l'hypothèse d'Opportunité de Niche dans le but d'expliquer la réussite de l'établissement et de la prolifération des espèces envahissantes. Selon ces auteurs, les espèces exogènes introduites sur une nouvelle aire géographique peuvent y profiter d'une part de la diminution de la pression exercée par leurs ennemis naturels et d'autre part d'une augmentation de la disponibilité de leurs ressources. Drosophila suzukii est une de ces espèces dites envahissantes. Originaire d'Asie, sa présence est aujourd'hui largement recensée en Amérique du Nord et dans tout l'ouest de l'Europe. Depuis son introduction en 2008, en Europe notamment, l'invasion de D. suzukii est particulièrement rapide et les dégâts engendrés dans les cultures par cette espèce qui se développe sur les fruits en cours de maturité sont très préoccupants. Au cours de nos travaux, nous avons mis en évidence certains caractères chez cette espèce comme étant des éléments facilitant le succès de son invasion. D. suzukii présente tout d'abord une grande résistance face à ses principaux ennemis naturels, les parasitoïdes. Nous avons ensuite montré l'existence d'un lien entre sa capacité à mettre en échec les parasitoïdes larvaires et son importante charge hémocytaire. Par ailleurs, grâce à un échantillonnage très large, nous avons illustré la grande polyphagie de cette espèce. Ce caractère lui assure potentiellement une disponibilité en ressources tout au long de l'année. Enfin, à l'aide d'une étude portant sur les relations tritrophiques, nous avons montré que la qualité nutritive des plantes hôtes utilisées par D. suzukii peut avoir un impact sur le niveau de sa résistance aux entomophages. D. suzukii parvient en effet à augmenter sa résistance à plusieurs espèces de parasitoïdes lorsqu'elle réalise son développement sur un substrat riche en alcaloïde. Nos derniers résultats suggèrent qu'elle serait même capable de réaliser une forme d'automédication. Les différentes études réalisées au cours de cette thèse semblent confirmer que D. suzukii profite d'une opportunité de niche en Europe tempérée},

In total, 450 adult D. suzukii emerged from 62 of 929 fruit collections, and from 10 host plant species in five families, of which six species are native to the region. Five plant species are reported for the first time as hosts of D. suzukii, and 11 species for the first time as non-hosts. Measures of fly occurrence and infestation reveal it to be relatively abundant in five hosts and low in others. The fly reproduced in a succession of host plants, with first infestation of each from mid-July through mid-September, and was present until mid-October, but overwintering stages were not found. Degree-day accumulations for the infested period suggest that three to five generations of D. suzukii developed on non-crop plants and formed a large contribution to the annual increases observed in trap counts in a semi-arid cold winter climate, with implications for many strategies of pest management.},

Trapping is one technique used for both detection and control; however, the efficacy of trapping can vary depending on the target insect's physiological state, its behavioural priorities and the type of attractant used in the trap. We conducted a series of caged trapping experiments and a greenhouse trapping experiment to investigate the effects of D. suzukii feeding status, age, mating status, ovipositional status and seasonal morph type on the capture rate of traps baited with fermentation odours. Starved flies were trapped at greater rates compared to fed flies; more virgin flies were trapped than mated flies; flies deprived of an oviposition substrate were trapped more frequently than flies given an oviposition substrate. It is still unclear whether age or seasonal morphology affect bait response. Lastly, a caged choice experiment investigated the relationship between female reproductive status and attraction to fermentation or fruit odours. Fermentation-based traps captured female flies regardless of their reproductive status but, ripe fruit-based traps were more attractive to flies with more than seven eggs. In summary, studies that use fermentation-based traps should recognize that capture rates of D. suzukii will depend on the feeding, mating and oviposition experiences of the population; also, fruit-based traps may better target gravid females.},

	abstract = {D. suzukii is a relatively recent and destructive pest species to the North American soft-skinned fruit industry. Understanding this species’ potential to shift in abundance and range due to changing climate is an important part of an effective mitigation and management strategy. We parameterized a temperature-driven D. suzukii population dynamics model using temperature data derived from several Global Circulation Models ({CMIP}5) with a range of relative concentration pathway ({RCP}) predictions. Mean consensus between the models suggest that without adaptation to both higher prolonged temperatures and higher short-term temperature events D. suzukii population levels are likely to drop in currently higher-risk regions. The potential drop in population is evident both as time progresses and as the severity of the {RCP} scenario increases. Some regions, particularly in northern latitudes, may experience increased populations due to milder winter and more developmentally-ideal summer conditions, but many of these regions are not currently known for soft-skinned fruit production and so the effects of this population increase may not have a significant impact.},

While much in the original remains relevant today, our aim in this edited volume is to bring together some of worlds leading insect researchers to bring the empirical and conceptual scope of the original book up to date. We explore the evolution of often complex forms of sex determination in insects, and the role of sexual selection in shaping the evolution of mating systems. Selection arising via male contest competition and female choice, both before and after copulation are discussed, as are the roles of parasites and pathogens in mediating the strength of sexual selection, and the role that parental care plays in successful reproduction.},

Relative abundance is determined by physiological date of first detection and air temperatures the previous winter. Date of first detection of flies does not determine date of fruit infestation. The level of fruit infestation is determined by year, fly pressure, and insecticide application frequency. Frequency of insecticide application is determined by production system. Non-crop wild fruit and predation influences fly pressure; increased wild fruit abundance results in increased fly pressure. Increased predation rate reduces fly pressure, but only at high abundance of flies, or when high levels of wild fruit are present along field edges. Male sex ratio might be declining over the seven years. Action thresholds were developed from samples of 92 fields from 2012–2017 that related cumulative adult male trap capture to the following week likelihood of fruit infestation. A two-parameter gamma density function describing this probability was used to develop a risk-based gradient action threshold system. The action thresholds were validated from 2016–2018 in 35 fields and were shown to work well in two of three years (2016 and 2017).},

	abstract = {The sterile insect technique ({SIT}) is an environment-friendly method of pest control that integrates well into area-wide integrated pest management ({AW}-{IPM}) programmes. This book takes a generic, thematic, comprehensive, and global approach in describing the principles and practice of the {SIT}. The strengths and weaknesses, and successes and failures, of the {SIT} are evaluated openly and fairly from a scientific perspective. The {SIT} is applicable to some major pests of plant-, animal-, and human-health importance, and criteria are provided to guide in the selection of pests appropriate for the {SIT}.
In the second edition, all aspects of the {SIT} have been updated and the content considerably expanded. A great variety of subjects is covered, from the history of the {SIT} to improved prospects for its future application. The major chapters discuss the principles and technical components of applying sterile insects. The four main strategic options in using the {SIT} — suppression, containment, prevention, and eradication — with examples of each option are described in detail. Other chapters deal with supportive technologies, economic, environmental, and management considerations, and the socio-economic impact of {AW}-{IPM} programmes that integrate the {SIT}. In addition, this second edition includes six new chapters covering the latest developments in the technology: managing pathogens in insect mass-rearing, using symbionts and modern molecular technologies in support of the {SIT}, applying post-factory nutritional, hormonal, and semiochemical treatments, applying the {SIT} to eradicate outbreaks of invasive pests, and using the {SIT} against mosquito vectors of disease. 
This book will be useful reading for students in animal-, human-, and plant-health courses. The in-depth reviews of all aspects of the {SIT} and its integration into {AW}-{IPM} programmes, complete with extensive lists of scientific references, will be of great value to researchers, teachers, animal-, human-, and plant-health practitioners, and policy makers.},

	abstract = {Life history parameters are used to estimate population dynamics, mortality, and reproduction in insects relative to their surrounding environment. For Drosophila suzukii Matsumura (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive agricultural pest, previous studies have estimated net reproductive rate (Ro), generation time (T), and intrinsic rate of population increase (rm). A main limitation is that these estimates were measured under relatively favorable settings, and do not reflect environmental conditions and physiological states encountered during dormancy periods. Therefore, this study investigated the impacts of 1) low temperatures and 2) dietary protein: carbohydrate ratios (P:C) on both survival and fecundity parameters of D. suzukii summer morphs ({SM}) and postoverwintering winter morphs ({WM}) over physiological age (degree-days, {DD}). In both morphs, reproductive rates were higher and lifespan was longer when flies were exposed to low protein (P:C 1:4) or carbohydrate-only diets (P:C 0:1) compared with high protein diets (P:C 1:1). {WM} had higher reproductive rates and longer generation times than {SM} on optimal 1:4 diet in all trialed temperatures, but at the lowest temperatures, {SM} had higher reproductive rates than {WM} in carbohydrate-only and high protein diets. This likely reflected delayed oogenesis and hindered reproduction after an overwintering period in {WM} receiving suboptimal diets. Oviposition for {SM} and {WM} receiving 1:4 diet commenced from 0 to 100 {DD}, and peaked between 400 and 500 {DD}, earlier than flies receiving 0:1 diet. These results suggest that dietary protein has a crucial role in early oogenesis, particularly for postoverwintering {WM}. The parameters developed here reflect the population dynamics of D. suzukii before and after the crop growing season, an essential time for population buildup, survival, and early and late host infestation.},

However, it is unclear which morphological traits are the best estimators of abiotic conditions, how those traits are correlated with functional outcomes in cold tolerance, and whether there are regional differences in trait expression. We used a combination of controlled laboratory assays, and collaborative field collections of invasive Drosophila suzukii in different areas of the United States, to study the factors affecting phenotype variability of this temperate fruit pest now found globally. Laboratory studies demonstrated that winter morph ({WM}) trait expression is continuous within the developmental temperature niche of this species (10–25°C) and that wing length and abdominal melanization are the best predictors of the larval abiotic environment. However, the duration and timing of cold exposure also produced significant variation in development time, morphology, and survival at cold temperatures. During a stress test assay conducted at −5°C, although cold tolerance was greater among {WM} flies, long-term exposure to cold temperatures as adults significantly improved summer morph ({SM}) survival, indicating that these traits are not controlled by a single mechanism. Among wild D. suzukii populations, we found that regional variation in abiotic conditions differentially affects the expression of morphological traits, although further research is needed to determine whether these differences are genetic or environmental in origin and whether thermal susceptibility thresholds differ among populations within its invaded range.},

From 10-28°C, temperature had a significant impact on blueberries, Vaccinium corymbosum L. (Ericales: Ericaceae), and cherries, Prunus avium (L.) L. 1755 (Rosales: Rosaceae), important commercial hosts of D. suzukii. Temperature had a significant influence on D. suzukii developmental period, survival, and fecundity, with decreasing developmental periods as temperatures increased to 28°C. At 30°C, the highest temperature tested, development periods increased, indicating that above this temperature the developmental extremes for the species were approached. D. suzukii reared on blueberries had lower fecundity than reared on cherries at all temperatures where reproduction occurred. The highest net reproductive rate (Ro) and intrinsic rate of population increase (rm) were recorded on cherries at 22°C and was 195.1 and 0.22, respectively. Estimations using linear and nonlinear fit for the minimum, optimal, and maximum temperatures where development can take place were respectively, 7.2, 28.1, and 42.1°C. The rm values were minimal, optimal, and maximal at 13.4, 21.0, and 29.3°C, respectively. Our laboratory cultures of D. suzukii displayed high rates of infection for Wolbachia spp. (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae), and this infection may have impacted fecundity found in this study. A temperature-dependent matrix population estimation model using fecundity and survival data were run to determine whether these data could predict D. suzukii pressure based on environmental conditions. The model was applied to compare the 2011 and 2012 crop seasons in an important cherry production region. Population estimates using the model explained different risk levels during the key cherry harvest period between these seasons.},

The simulation and prediction of D. suzukii's population dynamics would be helpful for guiding pest management. Therefore, we reviewed and summarized the current knowledge on effects of air temperature and relative humidity on different life cycle parameters of D. suzukii. The literature summary presented shows that high oviposition rates can occur between 18 and 30 °C. Temperatures between 16 and 25 °C resulted in fast and high egg-to-adult development success of more than 80\%. Oviposition and adult life span were positively affected by high relative humidity; however, the factor humidity is so far rarely investigated. We assume that this is one reason why relative humidity usually is not considered in modelling approaches, which are summarized herein. The high number of recently published research articles on D. suzukii's life cycle suggests that there is already a lot of knowledge available on its biology. However, there are still considerable research gaps mentioned in the literature, which are also summarized herein. Nevertheless, we conclude that sufficient temperature data in the literature are suitable to understand and predict population dynamics of D. suzukii, in order to assist pest management in the field.},

	abstract = {Spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), was monitored from 2010 to 2014 in 314–828 sites located in interior fruit-growing regions of {OR} and {WA}, United States, and {BC}, Canada, using traps baited with apple cider vinegar or sugar-water-yeast. Seasonal population dynamics and sex ratios were summarized for berry, cherry, stone fruit, grape, non-crop host plants, non-host sites, and for conventional {IPM}, certified organic, backyard, and feral sites, by region and year. Overwintering was detected in all regions and years, despite winter temperatures below −17°C. A spatial analysis was conducted using a Geographic Information System ({GIS}), daily weather data, geomorphometric measures of terrain, distance to water, and other variables, at each site. Overwintering success at a site, measured as Julian week of first capture of D. suzukii, was significantly related (R2 = 0.49) in cherry habitats to year, agronomic treatment, and number of winter days with temperatures \&gt;−5°C. In berry, cherry, stone fruit and grape habitats, 2011–2014, it was significantly related (R2 = 0.42) to year, agronomic treatment, the logarithm of peak population of D. suzukii in the prior autumn, latitude, elevation, and topographic wetness index. The results show that D. suzukii has adapted to exploit a succession of irrigated crops and feral habitats in mixed landscapes of a semi-arid region with cold winters and hot dry summers, and are shaping strategies for pest management and for biological control.},

	abstract = {The spotted-wing drosophila ( Drosophila suzukii Matsumura) is an invasive species of Asian origin that is now widely distributed in North America and Europe. Because of the female’s serrated ovipositor, eggs are laid in preharvest fruit, causing large economic losses in cultivated berries and stone fruit. Modeling D. suzukii population dynamics and potential distribution will require information on its thermal tolerance. Large summer populations have been found in regions with severe winter conditions, though little is known about responses to prolonged low-temperature exposure. We used controlled chambers to examine D. suzukii fecundity, development rate, and mortality across a range of temperatures encompassing the upper and lower thresholds (5–35°C). Optimal temperatures ( Topt ) were found to be 28.2°C for the development of the egg-to-adult stage, and 22.9°C for reproductive output. No adult eclosion occurred below 8.1°C ( Tlower ) or above 30.9°C ( Tupper ). We also investigated survival outcomes following prolonged (42-d) low-temperature exposure to a simulated cold winter (−5, −3, −1, 1, 3, and 5°C). Adult survival was dependent on temperature, with a mean {LT} 50 of 4.9°C. There were no effects of sex, mating status, geographic strain, and photoperiod preexposure on overwintering survival. Thirty-eight percent of females that were mated prior, but not after, prolonged low-temperature exposure produced viable offspring, suggesting that this species may undergo sperm storage. This study provides data on the thermal tolerances of D. suzukii , which can be used for models of D. suzukii population dynamics, degree-day, and distribution models.},

Here, we investigated, for the first time, the potential of using {SIT} to control D. suzukii in field conditions without physical barriers that limit insect invasion. A proprietary method of rearing and irradiation with X-rays was used to obtain males that were {\textgreater} 99\% sterile. Sterile males were released twice per week from April to October 2021 on a site in Kent, {UK}, where everbearing strawberries were grown in open polytunnels. The infestation of wild female D. suzukii was monitored weekly using red sticky traps with dry lure at the treated site and at two similar control sites that did not receive sterile male releases. Releases of sterile males suppressed the wild female D. suzukii population by up to 91\% in comparison with the control sites. We thus demonstrated the feasibility of {SIT} to achieve season-long control of D. suzukii using early, sustained and dynamically targeted releases of sterile males. This provides a promising environmentally friendly method to control this important pest.},

In 2019, a review summarized 75+ papers covering 57 species of {SWD} parasitoids, predators, competitors, and pathogens and identified the most promising ones. This review provides an update with recent studies. Since parasitoids are promising natural enemies that can be host-specific and self-disperse, this chapter focuses on {SWD} parasitoids in its invaded and native ranges, and prospects for classical biological control. To date, six species have been confirmed to attack {SWD} in the invaded regions including three widely studied generalist pupal parasitoids, Pachycrepoideus vindemiae, Trichopria drosophilae, and T. anastrephae. No locally occurring larval drosophila parasitoids can develop from {SWD}. In contrast, foreign explorations in China, Japan, and South Korea have revealed 19 species of {SWD} larval parasitoids. Asobara japonica, Ganaspis brasiliensis, and Leptopilina japonica spp. japonica have been evaluated. Ganaspis brasiliensis is a complex of cryptic species/strains with varying host specificity, some which also occur in regions outside of Asia, but one East Asian strain was found to be the most host-specific to {SWD} and is currently being petitioned for introduction into North America and Europe.},

Using adult trapping and fruit sampling, we studied the population dynamics of D. suzukii in coastal and mainland (semi-highland) cherry orchards of Greece, from 2018 to 2020. Adults were captured in traps baited with apple cider vinegar, placed in conventional and unmanaged sweet-cherry orchards, and in neighbouring wild growing hosts. Sampling of sweet-cherry fruit to assess infestation levels was conducted from early and late-ripening cherry cultivars in both areas. Adults were captured throughout the year in the coastal area with two peaks registered in spring and late-autumn. Captures were nearly zero during the hot summer months. Flight activity exhibited only one peak in autumn at the mainland area, and ceased during winter and spring. Captures in wild hosts were lower during the sweet-cherry ripening period than later in the season. Higher sweet-cherry infestation levels were recorded in the coastal than in the mainland area and in unmanaged than in commercial orchards. Both early and late-ripening cultivars were highly susceptible to D. suzukii infestation in the coastal area. Infestation rates were higher in late-ripening cultivars than in early-ripening ones in the mainland area. We conclude that D. suzukii has well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Greece, and is able to progressively exploit several crops and wild hosts of mainland and coastal areas.},

	abstract = {Drosophila suzukii is a polyphagous pest of small and soft fruit, originating from Asia, which has spread and established in Europe and the {USA}. Adults exhibit seasonal phenotypes, i.e., summer morphs ({SM}) and winter morphs ({WM}) to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions. {WM} have a darker cuticle and larger wings compared to {SM}, while {WM} females experience reproductive dormancy. We studied the life history traits (lifespan, female reproductive status and number of produced offspring) of {WM} and {SM} that were exposed to winter field conditions of a coastal and a mainland agricultural area, with mild and cold winter climates, respectively. Mated adults of each phenotype were individually placed in vials bearing nutritional/oviposition substrate, and transferred to the field from November 2019 to May 2020, when the death of the last individual was recorded. Almost all {SM} females (90\%) and no {WM} female carried mature ovarioles before being transferred to the field. {WM} exhibited a longer lifespan than {SM} adjusting for location and sex. Differences in survival between the two phenotypes were more pronounced for adults kept in the mainland area. The majority of {SM} females produced offspring during overwintering in the mild coastal area, but only a few {SM} were reproductively active in the cold mainland area. Some {WM} females produced progeny during overwintering in the mild conditions of the coastal area, but all {WM} females were in reproductive arrest in the mainland area. Overwintering females in the coastal area had a shorter lifespan and produced more progeny than those kept in the mainland area. High survival rates of {WM} provide indications of the successful performance of this phenotype in the adverse conditions of the cold climates. Additionally, the continuous reproductive activity of {SM} females and the onset of progeny production by {WM} females during overwintering in the coastal area indicate that the insect remains reproductively active throughout the year in areas with mild climatic conditions. Our findings support the successful adaptation of D. suzukii in both areas tested and can be used for the development of area-specific population models, based on the prevailing climatic conditions.},

These morphotypes are known to differ in thermal stress tolerance, and they co-occur during parts of the year. In this study, we aimed to estimate morph-specific survival and fecundity in laboratory settings simulating field conditions. We specifically analyzed how {WM} and {SM} D. suzukii differed in mortality and reproduction during and after a period of cold exposure resembling winter and spring conditions in temperate climates. The median lifespan of D. suzukii varied around 5 months for the {WM} flies and around 7 months for the {SM} flies. {WM} flies showed higher survival during the cold-exposure period compared with {SM} flies, and especially {SM} males suffered high mortality under these conditions. In contrast, {SM} flies had lower mortality rates than {WM} flies under spring-like conditions. Intriguingly, reproductive status (virgin or mated) did not impact the fly survival, either during the cold exposure or during spring-like conditions. Even though the reproductive potential of {WM} flies was greatly reduced compared with {SM} flies, both {WM} and {SM} females that had mated before the cold exposure were able to continuously produce viable offspring for 5 months under spring-like conditions. Finally, the fertility of the overwintered {WM} males was almost zero, while the surviving {SM} males did not suffer reduced fertility. Combined with other studies on D. suzukii monitoring and overwintering behavior, these results suggest that overwintered flies of both morphotypes could live long enough to infest the first commercial crops of the season. The high mortality of {SM} males and the low fertility of {WM} males after prolonged cold exposure also highlight the necessity for females to store sperm over winter to be able to start reproducing early in the following spring.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The global pest spotted winged drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) continues to have a significant economic impact on fruit production in areas where it is established, in addition to newly invaded ranges. Management activities spanning national biosecurity responses to farm-scale pest control are limited by the inability to predict the timing and severity of seasonal outbreaks of D. suzukii and its climatic drivers. {RESULTS} Here, we compiled and analysed data on international seasonal abundances for D. suzukii under different climates, crop types and management contexts to improve the predictability of seasonal population dynamics. In relating seasonal abundances to environmental predictors, specifically temperature, we found strong negative effects of exposure to high and low temperatures during the preceding month. Unlike most regional studies on D. suzukii phenology that focus on temperature in the physiological development range, we show that thermal extremes better explain seasonal population fluctuations. {CONCLUSION} Although trap catches remain an indirect measure of infestations and must be interpreted carefully in terms of crop risk, our results should support monitoring programmes through enhanced knowledge of the climatic factors affecting D. suzukii population activity. The negative impact of high temperatures suggests that late-season management strategies focusing on manipulating crop microclimates to temperatures above 25 °C can reduce D. suzukii abundance. We show that early season abundance is modulated by climate, particularly the depth of cold extremes experienced in the preceding time interval. These associations may be further developed into early-season crop risk forecasts to support monitoring programs. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.},

In this study conducted in Granada province in southern Spain, we analysed the flying activity and sex-ratio variability of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii (the spotted wing drosophila) in the context of environmental factors and compared it with co-occurring Drosophilidae in a village garden. The studied D. suzukii population showed overwintering capabilities and successful maintenance in village garden with non-crop plants. Its flight period showed two peaks: female-biased, in November, and male-biased, in May. The sex ratio varied throughout the year and was mostly female-biased. We observed the effect of temperature on Drosophilidae and rainfall and temperature on the D. suzukii. Catches of the studied species were minimal at the minimal temperatures below 0 °C, and absent or near absent when the maximal temperature exceeded 30 °C. Moreover, we did not observe D. suzukii in samples when the minimum temperature below 0 °C was combined with heavy rainfall. The spotted wing drosophila seems to be more sensitive to precipitation than native Drosophilidae, as its proportion in the samples decreased with increasing rainfall. This pest also shows more pronounced short peaks in which it makes an important proportion of the biocoenosis of in comparison with other Drosophilidae.},

Numbers of {SWD} trapped were significantly greater with a mixture of vinegar and wine compared with vinegar alone or wine alone. Attraction of {SWD} to vinegar and wine may be due in part to responses to acetic acid and ethanol evaporated from the two baits, respectively. Numbers of {SWD} captured in traps baited with 2\% acetic acid in water were significantly greater than in unbaited traps, indicating a fly response to acetic acid. Very few flies were captured in traps baited with 10\% ethanol in water. Traps baited with a combination of acetic acid and ethanol in water captured more {SWD} flies than traps baited with acetic acid or ethanol solutions alone. These results indicate a synergy of the two materials, and of the two chemicals, as lures for {SWD}. A comparison of a mixture of acetic acid with ethanol in water versus a mixture of vinegar with wine showed stronger fly attraction to the vinegar/wine mixture, indicating potential attractiveness of vinegar and wine volatiles in addition to acetic acid and ethanol.},

	abstract = {A high reproductive potential is one reason for the rapid spread of Drosophila suzukii in Europe and in the United States. In order to identify mechanisms that mediate mating and reproduction in D. suzukii we studied the fly’s reproductive behavior, diurnal mating activity and sexual maturation. Furthermore, we studied the change of female cuticular hydrocarbons ({CHCs}) with age and conducted a preliminary investigation on the role of female-derived chemical signals in male mating behavior. Sexual behavior in  D. suzukii is characterized by distinct elements of male courtship leading to female acceptance for mating. Time of day and age modulate D. suzukii mating activity. As with other drosophilids, female sexual maturity is paralleled by a quantitative increase in {CHCs}. Neither female {CHCs} nor other olfactory signals were required to induce male courtship, however, presence of those signals significantly increased male sexual behavior. With this pilot study we hope to stimulate research on the reproductive biology of D. suzukii, which is relevant for the development of pest management tools.},

	abstract = {Invasive insect pests can be challenging to manage because their recent arrival provides limited information on which to build predictive population models. The magnitude and timing of activity by the invasive vinegar fly, Drosophila suzukii, in crop fields has been unpredictable due to its recent arrival in many new regions of the world and changes in methods for its detection. Using 7 yr of consistent trapping of adults at four blueberry farms in Michigan, United States, we modeled the temporal and environmental factors influencing D. suzukii activity. We found that this pest established high levels within 2 yr of being detected, with peak fly activity continuing to increase. Fly activity timing and abundance were predicted by the annual number of days below 0°C, the number of winter and spring days above 10°C, and by the fly activity in the preceding year, providing support for overwintering in our region. We monitored larval infestation for 4 yr at these same sites and found a moderate positive correlation between larvae in fruit and adults in traps. Finally, we developed a generalized additive model to predict D. suzukii fly capture throughout the season based on relevant environmental factors and examined the relative timing and magnitude of activity under varying winter and spring temperature conditions. Our results suggest that D. suzukii activity is predictable and that environmental conditions can be used in temperate regions to provide regional risk warnings as a component of strategies to manage this invasive insect pest.},

Current control methods rely mainly on insecticides. The sterile insect technique ({SIT}) has potential as an additional control tactic for the integrated management of D. suzukii. As a step towards the development of the {SIT}, this study aimed at finding the optimum irradiation dose to sterilize D. suzukii under controlled laboratory conditions. Four-day-old D. suzukii pupae were irradiated 12 to 24 hours prior to adult emergence in a 60Co Gamma Cell 220 and in a 137Cs Gamma Cell 3000 with doses of 30, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100 or 120 Gy. Emergence rate (88.1\%), percent of deformed flies (4.0\%) and survival curves were not affected by the tested irradiation doses. However, some reproductive parameters of the flies were affected by irradiation. Females irradiated with a dose of 50 Gy or more had almost no fecundity. When non-irradiated females were mated with irradiated males, egg hatch decreased exponentially with irradiation dose from 82.6\% for the untreated control males to 4.0\% for males irradiated with 120 Gy. Mortality of F1 individuals from the irradiated treatment also occurred during larval and pupal stages, with an egg to adult survival of 0.2\%. However, descendants produced by the irradiated generation were fertile. These results are an encouraging first experimental step towards the development of the {SIT} for the management of D. suzukii populations.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of male and female sterilization on mating and remating behaviour of D. suzukii. First, we tested the occurrence of multiple mating in different combinations between sterile and fertile males and females. Then, we tested the effects of male and female sterility on female propensity to mate and remate. We found an overall low remating rate by D. suzukii females. Male sterility did not influence mating and remating likelihood; however, copula duration of sterile males was shorter compared to fertile males. On the other hand, sterile females were less likely to mate. Our findings encourage further research regarding the use of {SIT} to control D. suzukii.},

Field surveys of {SWD} have been extensively carried out for field-grown agricultural fruits, but no study has been conducted for greenhouse fruits, such as strawberries. In this study, {SWD} capture patterns were examined inside and outside of the greenhouse blocks, and in the nearby woodlands in a southwestern locality of Korea using selected traps and attractants for nearly 19 months—in addition to several greenhouse blocks—during the strawberry cultivating periods. The highest capture period was observed from October to mid-December in woodlands, whereas capture number subsequently and sharply decreased up to mid-April, resulting in mostly zero-captures or low captures (≤10). During this period, a zero-capture period was observed inside the greenhouse that lasted for nearly three months (late December to late February). An incubation of the fallen strawberries supported the results of trap capture from inside the greenhouses. Taken together, the occurrence of {SWD} in the strawberry greenhouses is likely to be highly dependent on that of the nearby woodlands. Thus, a sharp winter drop and the subsequent zero- or low-capture periods in the woodland areas were likely responsible for the observed zero-capture periods inside the greenhouses.},

The present studies were designed to describe the reproductive physiology in both sexes, through dissections of their reproductive organs. We extensively dissected female D. suzukii throughout the season from 2013 to 2016 and classified the reproductive status flies based on five recognizable ovarian maturation stages: 1) no ovaries; 2) unripe ovaries 3) ripening eggs in ovarioles; 4) mature eggs in ovarioles; and 5) mature eggs in the abdomen. Development was examined as a function of calendar days as well as degree-days ({DD}). Results obtained from winter collections revealed that females collected from November to March contained a lower percentage of mature eggs than females collected from April to September. These data suggest that environmental conditions during the dormant period induce reproductive diapause. Oogenesis likely increased with an increase in mean monthly temperatures and {DD}. The first overwintered females with mature eggs were dissected as early as 21 February 2014 in Trento (7 {DD}). Additionally, we found that a low proportion of males (less than 50\%) had sperm in their testes between January and March, yet during the same period females already have sperm stored in their spermathecal. Ivy berries was an alternative but unfavorable non-crop host during the late dormant period, as evidenced by emergence of smaller adults when compared to individuals emerging from cherry fruits. This study showed that D. suzukii females have great potential for oviposition early in the season, posing a risk to early season maturing crop hosts.},

	abstract = {Drosophila suzukii est une drosophile invasive en Europe, Amérique du Nord et Amérique du Sud. Contrairement aux autres espèces de drosophiles, les femelles parasitent les fruits mûrs que les larves consomment, engendrant d’importants dégâts sur les cultures fruitières. Les stratégies mises en place par cette espèce pour tolérer les températures hivernales sous nos latitudes sont encore peu comprises. Par conséquent, l’objectif de ma thèse était d’acquérir des connaissances fondamentales sur la thermotolérance de cette espèce, en m’intéressant notamment à la plasticité de la tolérance au froid et aux mécanismes physiologiques sous-jacents à l’acclimatation. J’ai évalué la thermotolérance basale de D. suzukii en soumettant des adultes et des pupes à un large panel de températures (froides et chaudes). Ces expérimentations ont permis de confirmer que cette espèce était intolérante au froid et que des températures supérieures à 32°C impactaient grandement sa survie. Par la suite, j’ai évalué la plasticité de sa tolérance au froid. Mes travaux ont permis de confirmer que sa thermotolérance était effectivement plastique, puisque l’utilisation de températures fluctuantes ou l’acclimatation permettaient de réduire sa mortalité lors d’expositions aux basses températures. L’acclimatation chez D. suzukii était corrélée à de nombreuses modifications physiologiques, telles que l’accumulation de cryoprotecteurs, un réajustement de la composition des phospholipides membranaires et des réserves lipidiques, une régulation des gènes liés à l’activité des transporteurs ioniques ainsi qu’un maintien de l’homéostasie métabolique. Ces modifications, également observées chez d’autres espèces d’insectes, pourraient être liées à l’augmentation de la tolérance au froid de D. suzukii, jouant probablement un rôle important dans sa survie hivernale et donc dans le succès de son invasion. Ces connaissances acquises sur sa thermobiologie contribueront sans doute à mieux cerner les limites physiologiques de cette espèce et prédire l’évolution de son invasion, ainsi que sa phénologie et les variations de populations au cours des saisons dans les zones déjà envahies. Mes résultats ouvrent également des perspectives intéressantes pour la mise en place de techniques de lutte intégrée contre D. suzukii.},

Irradiation doses were tested at 0, 60, 90, 110, 120, 150, and 180 Gy to select the optimal dose for producing sterile males. In addition, we examined the effects of mating sequence on offspring production where females were presented with irradiated males first and then wild males, or the reverse. Female D. suzukii were found to mate twice on average through their lifespan, with 16.53 ± 12.05 d between matings. The first mating duration was 24.64 ± 1.52 min shorter than the second mating. A dose of 90 Gy was suitable where irradiated males lived as long as non-irradiated males, and few eggs hatched from matings. The mating sequence experiment revealed first-male parentage preference. Wild females that mated with a wild male and then irradiated male produced more offspring than females mated with an irradiated and then wild male.

This study followed D. suzukii seasonal population dynamics in multiple cropping and riparian systems in four cherry-producing counties of the Valley. Apple cider vinegar baited traps were used to monitor D. suzukii adults weekly, from April 2013 to July 2014, in 28 fields. Results show peak captures in the spring and fall seasons. In cherry orchards, adult trap counts were the highest near harvest (June) and declined thereafter, as fly populations moved to other crop (e.g., citrus) or non-crop habitats. The number of captured adults was positively related between pairs of sampled sites based on their proximity but was negatively related to differences in fruit ripening periods between different crops, suggesting that fly populations moved among crop and/or non-crop habitats during the year or had varying population dynamics on different crops and in different seasons. Mature egg load per female was higher during the fruiting season but lower during the winter season, with the majority of winter-captured females not containing mature eggs. This survey also reports for the first time the presence of trapped D. suzukii adults bearing melanized and encapsulated parasitoids in North America, non-target captures of larval drosophilid parasitoids in the traps, as well as the occurrence of larvae in the ovaries of adult female D. suzukii.},
